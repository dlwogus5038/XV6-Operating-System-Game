Note that the original xv6 README was replaced with this one.

To run xv6 with the tetris user program, do make qemu as normal.

Build Dependencies: nasm

Display: You will need to be in an environment where the SDL display 
is available. If you are on a remote machine, you must enable X-forwarding.

/*** CODE ***/

The tetris.c file is just a user space dummy for the tetris sys call. The main
game loop is implemented in sysproc.c, in the sys_tetris function. This uses
functions in systetris.h and display.h to control game logic and display the
game state on the VGA respectively.

To draw the VGA in unchained mode with page flipping, set the MODE_UNCHAINED
macro to 1 in display.h. The tetris double buffer update is currently not 
supported in this format, but is close to completion. The issue will be
visible when running in this format, and requires a little extra logic
so we don't draw pixels in extra planes. Keep MODE_UNCHAINED as 0 for
now for expected visuals. There is no apparent difference in performance 
for the implemented code.
